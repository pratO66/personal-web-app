---

## Phase 8 — Analytics (Agent: analytics-agent)
**Connector:** Amplitude (appId `814849`, 10k events/mo starter plan)

- [ ] Install `@amplitude/analytics-browser` in frontend
- [ ] Track: `page_viewed` (route + referrer), `cv_downloaded`, `contact_submitted`,
      `project_link_clicked` (demo/repo), `skill_filter_changed`, `experience_viewed`
- [ ] Create Amplitude dashboard: Unique visitors · Top pages · Contact conversion rate
- [ ] Add `pnpm test:coverage` Amplitude event on CI pass (optional)
- [ ] Backend: log structured JSON events for Railway health + contact submissions
- [ ] Supabase: `analytics_events` table for server-side event mirror

---

## Phase 9 — Spotify Integration (Agent: spotify-agent)

- [ ] Expand on first user interaction (solves browser autoplay block)
- [ ] Pulse animation synced to play state (CSS, no Web Audio needed)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_TRACK_ID` env var so track can be swapped

**Note:** Full autoplay on page load is blocked by all major browsers. Embed widget
lets user click ▶ once — stays collapsed until then.

---

## Phase 10 — Citation / Credits Page (Agent: citation-agent)

- [ ] New route `/credits` — `app/credits/page.tsx`
- [ ] Add "CREDITS" link to Navbar
- [ ] Sections:
  - **Stack** — all libraries, frameworks, and tools with links + license

  - **Music** — "The Rebel Path" · Refused · Cyberpunk 2077 OST · CD PROJEKT RED
  - **Fonts** — Orbitron (Google Fonts), Share Tech Mono, Rajdhani
  - **Hosting** — Vercel, Railway, Supabase
  - **Inspiration** — developer portfolios referenced
- [ ] HUDChrome-styled cards per section, cyberpunk aesthetic

---

## Phase 11 — Job Application Tracker (Agent: job-tracker-agent)
**Access:** Admin-protected (`/admin/jobs`)

### Backend
- [ ] Supabase migration: `job_applications` table
  ```sql
  id, company, role, url, source (LinkedIn/Referral/…), status
  (Bookmarked/Applied/Phone Screen/Technical/Final/Offer/Rejected/Ghosted),
  applied_at, last_updated, notes, salary_min, salary_max, currency
  ```
- [ ] Spring Boot: `JobApplication` entity + repo + service + controller (`/api/admin/jobs/**`)
- [ ] CRUD endpoints: POST create · GET list (filterable by status) · PATCH update status · DELETE

### Frontend
- [ ] `/admin/jobs` page (admin-gated, client component)
- [ ] Kanban-style status board using HUDChrome cards per column
- [ ] Add/edit modal using TerminalInput components
- [ ] Status badge with cp-red/cp-yellow/cp-teal colour coding
- [ ] Export to CSV button

---

## Phase 12 — Market Research Engine (Agent: market-research-agent)
**API:** Adzuna Jobs API (free, 250 calls/day) · No scraping

### Backend
- [ ] Spring Boot `MarketResearchService`:
  - Calls Adzuna `/v1/api/jobs/{country}/search` with role keywords from profile
  - Extracts top N required skills from job descriptions (regex + keyword frequency)
  - Stores results in Supabase `market_insights` table (TTL 24h)
- [ ] Scheduled job (`@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * *")`) refreshes every night
- [ ] Endpoint: `GET /api/admin/market/insights` → top skills, avg salary, job count by role
- [ ] Env vars: `ADZUNA_APP_ID`, `ADZUNA_APP_KEY`

### Frontend
- [ ] `/admin/market` page — top skills radar chart vs your current skills
- [ ] Salary band per role with market median overlay
- [ ] "Skill gaps" section: skills in demand you don't list on your profile
- [ ] "Resume suggestions" list auto-generated from gap analysis

---

## Phase 13 — Resume Auto-Updater (Agent: resume-updater-agent)
**Depends on:** Phase 12 (market insights)

### Backend
- [ ] `ResumeUpdateService`:
  - Reads market insights (Phase 12) + current `profile` from Supabase
  - Generates diff: missing skills, outdated tagline, under-represented highlights
  - Returns structured `ResumeSuggestion` objects (field, current value, suggested value, confidence)
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/resume/suggestions` — returns suggestions
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/resume/apply` — applies approved suggestions to `profile` table
- [ ] Audit log in Supabase `resume_change_log` (field, old, new, applied_at)

### Frontend
- [ ] `/admin/resume` page — split view: current profile left, suggestions right
- [ ] Per-suggestion: Accept / Dismiss / Edit-then-Accept actions
- [ ] Confidence score badge (High/Medium/Low) on each suggestion
- [ ] "Apply All Accepted" bulk action → calls `/api/admin/resume/apply`
- [ ] After apply: triggers Vercel redeploy via API so live site updates

---

## Phase 14 — LinkedIn Sync (Agent: linkedin-agent)
**Approach:** LinkedIn data export (no scraping) + manual OAuth import

> **Why not full API?** LinkedIn's r_member_social scope (reading your own posts)
> requires app review and is granted to very few developers. The data export
> approach is ToS-compliant and gives full fidelity.

- [ ] Supabase: `linkedin_snapshots` table (exported JSON blobs + parsed fields)
- [ ] Backend `LinkedInParserService`:
  - Accepts uploaded LinkedIn data export ZIP (from Settings → Data Privacy → Export)
  - Parses `Profile.csv`, `Positions.csv`, `Skills.csv`, `Recommendations_Received.csv`
  - Maps to `profile` + `experience` table updates
  - Returns diff preview before applying
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/linkedin/import` — multipart upload → parsed diff
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/linkedin/apply` — applies diff to Supabase
- [ ] Frontend `/admin/linkedin` page — upload zone + diff review

### LinkedIn Share Output (auto-generate, not auto-post)
- [ ] "Generate LinkedIn Post" button on each project/experience entry
- [ ] Uses profile + project data to draft a LinkedIn-ready post (copyable)
- [ ] "Generate Updated Summary" — drafts a new LinkedIn About section from current profile

---

## Phase 15 — Developer Benchmarking (Agent: dev-benchmark-agent)
**API:** GitHub public API (no auth needed, 60 req/hr · 5000 req/hr with token)

### Data collected per developer
- Public repos count · Stars received · Forks · Top languages (by bytes)
- Contribution streak · Pinned repos · Account age

### Backend
- [ ] `GitHubBenchmarkService`: fetches your profile + compares against a curated
      list of 20–50 target developers (stored in `benchmark_peers` table)
- [ ] `BenchmarkResult`: percentile rank per language, repos, stars, contribution frequency
- [ ] Cache results in Supabase `github_benchmarks` (TTL 7d)
- [ ] `GET /api/profile/benchmark` — public endpoint (no auth)
- [ ] Env var: `GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional, increases rate limit)

### Frontend
- [ ] Public `/benchmark` page — radar chart: your GitHub stats vs peer median
- [ ] Language breakdown bar chart (your distribution vs peers)
- [ ] "Top peers" leaderboard (anonymised by default, opt-in to show username)
- [ ] "Add peer" widget (admin-only, adds GitHub handle to benchmark list)

---

## Phase 16 — Professional Development Dashboard (Agent: pro-dev-agent)
**Access:** Admin-only (`/admin/growth`)

### Data sources
- Your `profile.skills` + `experience` (Supabase)
- Market insights (Phase 12)
- GitHub benchmarks (Phase 15)
- Manual learning log (new table)

### Backend
- [ ] Supabase migration: `learning_log` table
  ```sql
  id, resource_type (Course/Book/Cert/Project/Talk), title, provider,
  url, status (In Progress/Completed/Planned), completed_at, notes
  ```
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/growth/summary` — aggregated snapshot (skills coverage %, learning velocity, next recommended skills)
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/growth/log` + PATCH/DELETE — CRUD for learning log

### Frontend
- [ ] `/admin/growth` page with 4 panels:
  1. **Skill coverage** — your skills vs top-10 market skills (filled radar)
  2. **Learning log** — kanban: Planned → In Progress → Completed
  3. **GitHub activity** — contribution calendar embed (github-readme-stats iframe)
  4. **Next 3 recommended skills** — derived from market gaps + current trajectory

- Coding standards: Java 21 records/sealed types where appropriate; TypeScript strict; Tailwind 4 CSS-first tokens; no inline styles except dynamic colour values
- Test requirement: every new backend class ≥ 95% JaCoCo coverage; every new frontend component has a Vitest test file
- Commit convention: `feat(phase-N): description` with Co-Authored-By trailer

### Execution order
```
Parallel batch 1 (no dependencies):
  analytics-agent · spotify-agent · citation-agent · polish-agent

Sequential batch 2 (job tracker is standalone):
  job-tracker-agent

Sequential batch 3 (market research must finish first):
  market-research-agent → resume-updater-agent

Parallel batch 4 (independent of batch 3):
  linkedin-agent · dev-benchmark-agent

Sequential batch 5 (needs batch 3 + 4):
  pro-dev-agent
```
